# Protocols

The calls can be made with one or more scientists. If there are more than one, one of them acts as moderator who is responsible for the call organisation and contact with the parents. If there is only one scientist (as there will be in the majority of cases), that person will act as the moderator. 
You can see examples of articles written prior to calls (normally quite short) on the *Articles* section of our website. Note that the articles also often include experimental details to help the families prepare. Risk assessment examples are in the Risk Assessments folder. Not every call requires an experiment, though it's great if you can have one!

*Initial Contact*
- You will be placed in contact with a parent/guardian following confirmation of your DBS validity, and a good match is made
- Following this, it is up to you to organise times and dates for calls
- If at any point you need to step away from the programme, let us know so we can potentially repair the family

**Preparation before the very first call:**
- Find out about child age & interests
- Decide on the topic - with other scientists (if applicable)
   1. Do not have too many people the child has not met
   2. Remember ‘next door’ aim to create personal connections
   3. Aim to focus on what they're interested, but also see if you can weave in your own work
- Confirm regular times (via email) and mode of communication - aim for once every two weeks minimum, a 40 min slot ideally.

**Preparation before a call:**
- Find links to any material – video/photo/explanations/experiments
- Put links into a plan, use old article posts on the website, or create a new one
- If you do create something new, please send it along to us to upload onto the website
- Any experiments require a Risk Assessment (see Risk Assessment folder). Use the template if you need to create a new one, or use an old one if applicable
- If you are designing a new experiment, please send us the Risk Assessment to upload
- Send to risk assessment to parent, confirm that they are OK with the experiment, have materials/equipment
- Plan the call outline (see below)
- Send an email with what you will be discussing, possible links for experiment (e.g. YouTube), and some "pre-reading" article ideally written ahead of time + reminder that parent is to be present through the call and all the experiments (standard phrase at the end of message). This should ideally be sent at least 48 hours before the start of the call
- Think of what would be interesting for next time

**Call Outline**

**Very First Call**

- Check equipment – i.e. that video/audio works fine
- Introduce yourself and your research/scientific interests, or what your profession/background is
- Clarify child’s age and interests
- Explain protocol of the call (see next)
- Clarify parent has to be present through the duration of the call
- No recording of the call (can take pics if everyone is happy)

**Standard Call**

*At the beginning*
- Moderator, starts 15 minutes before and shares a link via email
- When child-parent log in:
  * Say Hi, ask how they’ve been and what they’ve done
  * Introduce any new people, say names and what they research
- Ask what the child(ren) know about the topic you've decided to discuss

*During*
- Chat about the topic, and if you can refer to things written in the article to help convey any messages
- If applicable, discuss how your research/scientific interest is related to the topic
- 20-25 min into call, begin experiment (if applicable). If they are doing it, walk them through the setup. If you are doing it, make sure they can see what's happening clearly


*End:*
- Ask what was interesting and what they have learned?
- Try and give them a little bit of homework, particularly if involves using their experiment!
- Ask them to think about something they don’t know and ask us next time
- What would they like to talk about next time? Propose ideas.
- If its been a few calls, ask parents to fill in the feedback form on the website

*After:*
- Tidy up the blog, add any extra material discussed 

**Experiments**

- Fill in a Risk assessment form 
- Send it to parents BEFORE the call
- Confirm parents are OK and have supplies
- Upload experiments online (with risk assessment attached) 

**Communication After**
- Discussion in blogs for everyone, not just us!
- Promote/collect ideas for group calls on a topic of interest!
